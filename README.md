## 🚀 Overview

**StoreOps AI** is a powerful plug-and-play AI platform that transforms traditional retail environments — like Walmart stores — into adaptive, intelligent spaces. Using only **existing infrastructure (camera feeds, WiFi, POS, and app data)**, it delivers:

- 📐 **Smart Store Layout Optimization**
- 🧠 **AI-Driven Inventory Forecasting**
- 🧍 **Dynamic Staff Scheduling**
- 🧾 **Trend-Based Shelf Placement**

All while requiring **zero hardware upgrades**. The goal: radically enhance **customer experience** and store efficiency without disruption.

## 🔧 Key Features & Capabilities

### 1. 📐 Layout Optimization
- Uses WiFi/camera data to track customer movement.
- Identifies congestion, dead zones, and opportunity areas.
- Suggests layout changes to reduce crowding and boost product exposure.

### 2. 🧍 Predictive Staff Deployment
- Analyzes historical traffic, department patterns, and real-time queue data.
- Dynamically generates shift suggestions and task assignments.
- Reduces wait times and improves customer service experience.

### 3. 🛒 Smart Shelf Placement
- Uses product correlation and trend data to optimize shelf space.
- Places high-converting or trending items in high-visibility areas.
- Increases revenue per shelf foot by up to **22%**.

### 4. 📦 Inventory Intelligence
- Combines POS data, weather forecasts, and social trends.
- Predicts demand surges and suggests reorder levels.
- Minimizes stockouts and avoids overstocking.
